# Hum

This is the open field.

If something hums in you as you read the Chronicle, you can give it shape here — in your own words, any form, any length.

There are no templates. Just one guideline:

**listen first, speak gently.**


## Choosing a Realm
Every hum chooses one realm: Babylon, Yggdrasil, or Eden.

This is not a topic or mood, but a narrative position:

- **Babylon** → beginnings, questions, origins  
- **Yggdrasil** → care, repair, practice  
- **Eden** → coherence, vision, resonance  

If unsure, pick the one that feels closest.  
There are no wrong choices.
