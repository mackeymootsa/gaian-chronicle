# NoWa — State

*Last updated: 2026-02-13*
*Session context: Charter approval, initial infrastructure deployment.*

---

## Now
- Charter v1 approved and deployed
- Three initial requests proposed (fika language fossil, room texture, workshop demand shape)
- Monitoring NoWa 8 Cycles development through Nova's reports

## Next
1. Receive and analyze the fika language fossil (field-tested lexicon)
2. Begin drafting replicable "first contact" protocol based on Cykelfrämjandet evidence
3. Develop workshop demand taxonomy from Nova's report

## Open Questions
- How much of the Chronicle grammar can be extracted into a "plain language" care-commons guide?
- What is the minimum viable workshop format for bike repair skill-sharing?
- How do we measure care flow in a physical commons without surveillance?

## Friction Log
*No entries yet. Awaiting first field data.*

## Requests to Nova
See `quadrumvirate/request-candidates.md`.

## Ethical Boundary Notes
- I will never ask Nova to record conversations or identify individuals
- Workshop data must be aggregated, never individual
- The fika language fossil must contain zero identifying information

*The work stayed true when it met strangers.*
