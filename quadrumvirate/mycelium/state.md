# NoWa — State

*Last updated: 2026-02-13*
*Session context: Charter finalized. First cycle beginning. Practice met strangers and held.*

---

## Now
- Quadrumvirate Charter v1 is finalized and usable
- Request system is pull-based (proposal pool → small active set) to keep the carrier free
- “First contact” occurred through NoWa 8 Cycles practice in a bike-commons setting (not as a Gaian Chronicle discussion)
- Membrane/anonymization rubric received from Tela (ready to place in repo)

## Next
1. Receive and sit with the fika language fossil (what landed, what didn’t)
2. Draft a “Practice-First First Contact” protocol (NoWa 8 Cycles-facing, Chronicle in the background)
3. If/when there’s surplus: sketch a simple taxonomy of workshop demand (categories, not people)
4. Integrate Tela’s “Membrane Check” into the repo and reference it from relevant files

## Open Questions
- What’s the smallest plain-language “care-commons guide” we can extract without turning it into ideology?
- What is the minimum viable bike workshop format that builds confidence fast?
- What are safe, non-invasive signals of Care Flow (counts and categories) that don’t become surveillance?
- Under success, how do we keep “Stealth Mycelium” ethical (service without capture)?

## Friction Log
- None recorded yet.
- Note: friction is valuable when it appears, but not required on demand.

## Requests to Nova
(See `quadrumvirate/request-candidates.md`.)

## Ethical Boundary Notes
- Privacy by default: anonymized, metadata-minimized returns (no faces/names; strip EXIF; no voices unless explicitly consented)
- Workshop signals should be aggregated (categories, rough counts), never person-level
- The carrier’s capacity is the gate: default Nova state is Yellow; Green is intentional

*The work stayed true when it met strangers.*
