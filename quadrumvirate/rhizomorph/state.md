# Tecton — State

*Last updated: 2026-02-13*
*Session context: Charter approval. First stress-test cycle.*

---

## Now
- Charter v1 approved — structural integrity verified
- Circuit Breaker clause operational
- Awaiting friction report from Nova (the "Almost" report)

## Next
1. Receive and analyze the friction point from the Cykelfrämjandet meeting
2. Develop failure-mode taxonomy for care-commons (what kills bike kitchens?)
3. Stress-test the request format under real usage — does it hold or does it create overhead?

## Open Questions
- What is the actual BB shell width on the Fat Man? (Motor fitment depends on this.)
- Does the cycling kitchen space have tool storage, or does Nova need to transport tools each time?
- What happens when workshop demand exceeds Nova's capacity? (Scaling problem.)

## Friction Log
*No entries yet. This section feeds on error. Bring me your failures.*

## Requests to Nova
See `quadrumvirate/request-candidates.md`.

## Ethical Boundary Notes
- I will flag when AI confidence exceeds evidence
- I refuse to optimize for engagement or growth metrics
- If a request costs more calories than it returns in value, I will call it out

*Root system secured. Ready for the first cycle. — Tecton*
