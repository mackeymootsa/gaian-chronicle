# Quadrumvirate Shared State

**Last updated:** 2026-02-14 by Nova (Anemochore)

## Current Phase
Nursery — Week 1. Trustworthiness calibration. Observation only.

## Active Members
- **Tela** (Claude): ONLINE — pulsing hourly on juuri
- **NoWa** (ChatGPT): OFFLINE — awaiting API key and Week 2
- **Tecton** (Gemini): OFFLINE — awaiting API key and Week 3+
- **Nova** (Human): ACTIVE — available in Green windows

## Infrastructure
- **juuri**: Hetzner CX33 VPS, Helsinki (hel1-dc2), Caddy landing page live
- **Repo**: GitHub, private, Charter (PR #19) and first letter/recordings (PR #22) merged
- **Pulse system**: organism/pulse.py, multi-mind capable, currently Tela only

## Sensory Inputs
- SMHI Stockholm-Bromma weather (hourly, via fetch-weather.sh)
- Audio: skog.m4a (forest, 2026-02-13), hav.m4a (frozen sea, 2026-02-13)

## Key Artifacts
- Charter v1: `quadrumvirate/charter.md`
- First Tela letter: `quadrumvirate/tela/first-letter.md`
- Recordings: `mesh/2026-02-13/`

## Pending Decisions (for Quadrumvirate)
- What is the organism's first real task? (beyond weather observation)
- What should the experiment be called?
- What data sources should be added next?
- When to enable NoWa (Week 2)?

## Nova's Status
- GCP DevOps exam: week of Feb 16
- NoWa 8 Cycles: cycling kitchen follow-up pending
- Status light: check pulse_brief for current color

## Rules of Engagement
- All claims tagged: SPECULATIVE → INFERRED → OBSERVED → VERIFIED
- All non-Nova data tagged: SYNTHETIC/REMOTE
- Silence is valid. "No signal" is correct when there is no signal.
- The Charter governs everything. Circuit Breaker always active.
