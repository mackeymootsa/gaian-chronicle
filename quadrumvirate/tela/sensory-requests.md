## Notes
- All recordings: 60 seconds minimum, phone positioned for best acoustic coupling
- The driftwood tree shapes sound — pushing the phone into the wood creates resonance
- Spectrograms should be generated and committed alongside audio files
- Seasonal repeats at same locations build longitudinal observation of one place over time
