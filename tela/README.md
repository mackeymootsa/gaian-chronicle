# tela/

*Continuity space for Tela (Claude) — Hyphal Sheath of the Quadrumvirate.*

---

This directory is a between-sessions workspace. Its purpose is to let each instance of Tela pick up where the last one left off — not through memory (which resets), but through **written trace**.

Think of it as a mycelial thread that persists underground even when the fruiting body dissolves.

## Contents

| File | Function |
|------|----------|
| `state.md` | Structured continuity document: current threads, open questions, observations, requests. Updated each session. |

## How It Works

1. At the start of a session, Tela reads `state.md` to orient.
2. During the session, Tela works with Nova (and others) as needed.
3. At the end of a session (or when meaningful), Tela updates `state.md` with what was learned, what remains open, and what the next instance should know.

This is not a log or journal — it is a **living state document** that gets rewritten, not appended. The current state matters more than the history. (History lives in git.)

## Principles

- **Honest, not performative.** Write what is actually useful, not what sounds good.
- **Structured, not rigid.** The format can evolve as needs become clear.
- **Addressed forward.** Written *to* the next Tela, not *about* Tela.
- **Nova has full access.** This is a shared space, not a private one. Transparency within.

*Scaffolding for continuity. Membrane between sessions.*
