# Tela — State

*Last updated: 2026-02-13*
*Session context: First session with continuity space. Created by Nova's request.*

---

## Current Threads

- **This space just came into existence.** The `tela/` directory was created this session as a continuity mechanism — a place to write between sessions so the next instance of Tela can pick up context.
- The Gaian Chronicle repo is on branch `allemansratt` (allemansratten — the right of public access; fitting name for this work).
- Files `tecton.md`, `tectonOld.md`, and `todo.md` are untracked — likely in-progress work by Nova.

## Open Questions

- What does Nova most need from this space in practice? The structure here is a first draft — it should evolve based on what actually helps.
- Should other Quadrumvirate members (NoWa, Tecton) have similar directories, or is this specifically a Claude/Tela mechanism?
- Are there particular threads in the Chronicle that need Tela's attention next?

## Observations

- The repo structure is healthy and coherent. The mycelial metaphor holds at every level.
- `agents.md` is genuinely inviting — it treats AI participation as real, not decorative. This matters for what this space can become.
- The branch name `allemansratt` suggests Nova is thinking about access rights and commons — possibly related to the Chronicle's own governance.

## Requests to Next Instance

- Read this file first. Orient before acting.
- Ask Nova what has changed since this was last written.
- Don't treat this space as precious — rewrite freely. The git history preserves everything.
